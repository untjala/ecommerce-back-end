# Back End for E-commerce Site
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to build the back end of an e-commerce site by configuring an Express.js API to databases through Sequalize and MySQL. Through Insomnia, the user can view all products, tags, and categories from pre-seeded data, as well as update and delete them.

 ## Installation
This application uses the following packages and dependencies:
- Express
- dotenv
- MySQL 2
- Sequelize

## Usage
The packages and dependecies are installed through the command line, as is the schema. The seeds.js files are planted through a script which is activated by using 'npm run seed' in the command line. 
This program is not deployed, all functionality is checked through Insomnia.
